## This client will have a lot of fixes from the previous forked `exteraGram` project.
The `dixsinGram` client is currently being **developed**!

- This telegram client can be used to copy and `fix bugs`!
- This telegram client has very frequent `updates`!
- Our telegram client allows you to maintain complete user `confidentiality`!

## **exteraGram** can be built with **Android Studio** or from the command line with **Gradle**:
### Windows: 
```
gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```
### Linux: 
```
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```
